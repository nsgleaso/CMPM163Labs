Description of Cubes:

- Left Cube = This is my own shader where I made the time (u_time) and resolution of the renderer (u_resolution) alternate the color gradients of the cube.  The RGB values are set equal to the absolute value of sin(u_time) or cos(u_time) which is then multiplied by gl_FragCoord.x/u_resolution.
- Top Cube = this is my own part 1 cube.  For the material, I set the wireframe of the material to true, and added a light blue specular attribute to it.  As a result, the wireframe shines with a tinge of blue.
- Middle Cube = This is the part 1 tutorial cube.  the code is unchanged.
- Right Cube = This is the part 2 tutorial cube.  The only change that I made is the color interpolation, in that it is now red and blue.
